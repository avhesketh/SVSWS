Settlement &amp; community development under warming

These data are looking at how the community is changing over time. Tiles are black or white to passively manipulate temperature, and these data are stored in the 'ibuttons' folder.
The tides.R script looks at when the tiles are out of water and selects ibutton data for those times to look at differences in temperature
The species_plots.R and species_models.R are looking at changes in specific species through time.

Still need to do NMDS analysis or similar to track communities through time.
