## Questions

This experiment set out to test how temperature shapes the composition of intertidal algal and invertebrate communities. While the experiment was initially designed to investigate this broad question through the lens of herbivory-temperature interactions, high temperatures and disturbance regimes at the site prevented our original methodology from working, and subsequently we instead asked: how do single vs. successive hot summers affect this same community?

## Hypotheses

1.  Barnacle bed communities that are exposed to hotter temperatures during summer, even for a single year, will have lower diversity (species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, evenness, beta diversity) than those that are exposed to ambient/cooler conditions during the same period.

2.  There will be an interactive effect between the temperature treatments of the first and second summer on the same response metrics. Previously 'cool' communities, since they have more established, larger barnacle beds with a more diverse array of microhabitats and thermal refugia, will experience a smaller decline in diversity when exposed to warm temperatures than previously 'warm' communities that have less structural complexity (fewer barnacles). Meanwhile, previously 'warm' communities will increase substantially in diversity when allowed to recover in 'cool' conditions as recruitment and successional processes occur normally. Thus, diversity of communities after a second summer will fall in the order: cool-cool (highest diversity); cool-warm; warm-cool; warm-warm.

## Materials & Methods

#### Site description

This experiment was completed at Ruckle Provincial Park on the southeast-facing, semi-exposed sandstone shore of Salt Spring Island, located in British Columbia within the Salish Sea (Fig. 1). Relative to the rest of the southern Gulf Islands, this site receives more substantial wave exposure and cooler, saltier water, being positioned more towards the Strait of Juan de Fuca and away from the Fraser River plume. Thus, the intertidal community at this site is substantially more diverse than neighbouring islands. However, like the rest of the Gulf Islands, this island's intertidal zone is a "hot spot" in the region due to its mid-day summer low tides coupled with relatively clear, sunny weather during the summer.

<br/>

The upper intertidal zone at this site is dominated by acorn barnacles (*Balanus glandula* and *Chthamalus dalli*), with sporadic beds of the perennial brown alga *Fucus distichus* and patches of the crustose phase of *Mastocarpus* sp.. Ephemeral algae can be found primarily in the winter when temperatures less stressful, namely the green ephemeral species *Ulothrix* sp. and *Ulva* sp., the red alga *Pyropia* sp., and the brown alga *Petalonia fascia*. Herbivores are relatively plentiful at this shore level, though some more thermally sensitive species migrate down shore with the onset of summer temperatures (Hesketh, personal observation). These include the littorine snails *Littorina scutulata* and *L. sitkana* and the limpets *Lottia paradigitalis* and congeners *L. digitalis*, *L. pelta*, and *L. scutum*.

<br/>

#### Experimental design

Measurements in this experiment were made at the level of individual tiles deployed in the intertidal zone (Fig. 2). These tiles were manufactured as in previous studies employing the same passive warming method (@kordas2015). In short, tiles consisted of two units made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, a lower unit composed of thicker white HDPE (9.5 mm) anchoring the tile to the underlying bedrock, and an upper unit made of thinner HDPE (6.4 mm) that was either white (cool temperature treatment) or black (warm temperature treatment). A thin layer of Sea Goin' poxy putty (Permalite Plastics) was spread in the central 6.9 x 6.9 cm area of the top unit to generate a settlement surface. To enhance the fine-scale heterogeneity of the surface, finely ground epsom salts were pressed into the putty as it dried, and dissolved with water after drying to leave behind fine pock marks. When tile colour was altered for a subset of tiles during the second year of the study, this was accomplished using heavy-duty tape, either white or black in colour (Gorilla Tape), with adhesion enhanced by the application of super glue.

**Figure 2.** Experimental tiles deployed at Ruckle Provincial Park, Salt Spring Island, pictured one year after their initial installation on shore. Recruitment and growth of algae and barnacles is evident in the central settlement area of each tile, while the outer black or white area of each tile serves to passively generate the warm and cool treatments used during this experiment, respectively.

<br/>

The experiment followed a stratified random design, which went through several iterations as the original herbivore manipulation changed in response to methodological complications, and then again after the final question changed.

1.  **Original herbivory x warming design (March - June 2019):** In this design, we had five blocks of 20 tiles each, half of which were white and half of which were black. Copper fences were installed along the perimeter of each tile (0.511 mm thick, 3.8 cm high above the level of the tile). Each of these ten tiles had a different herbivore treatment applied: no herbivores, *L. paradigitalis* alone, *L. digitalis* alone, *L. scutulata* alone, *L. sitkana* alone, each two-way combination of herbivores, and all herbivores. Prior to treatments, we dissected a number of individuals of each species to determine the species-specific relationship between wet and dry tissue weight for each. Thus, when applying herbivores to the tiles, we attempted to standardize wet weight to \~120 mg of dry tissue weight per tile. Thus, there was one replicate of each treatment per tile, n=5 across all blocks.
2.  **Updated herbivory x warming design (June 2019 - August 2019):** For this design, tiles were moved to new locations to avoid log damage, log-damaged tiles were removed, and littorine snails were removed from the herbivore treatment pool since they were dislodged or appeared in treatments randomly due to wave action. This resulted in a new design of six experimental blocks with 16 tiles each, eight of which were black and eight of which were white. Only limpets were used in the herbivory treatments (Fig. 3), of which there were eight: no herbivores, *L. paradigitalis* alone, *L. digitalis* alone, *L. scutum* alone, each of the three two-species combinations of these, and all species. Thus, there was again a sample size of five per treatment, one replicate per block.

**Figure 3.** Stage 2 of experimental herbivore additions. Pictured here: *L. digitalis* (large, ribbed limpet) and *L. paradigitalis* (small limpets) added to a cool treatment tile in July 2019.

<br/>

3.  **Final design (August 2019-February 2021):** While the limpet manipulation worked reasonably well for *L. paradigitalis*, the other two limpet species more often than not died within two weeks of being added to tiles, presumably due to heat stress (Hesketh, personal observation). What limpets of these species did survive were often found at the edges of the tile units, or wedged in the crack between the tile and copper fence, signaling that their grazing activity on the tile may be minimal. Thus, at this point the copper fences were removed from all tiles, and herbivores of all species were allowed to access and leave tiles freely. In April 2020, the colour of half of these tiles were changed (white -\> black or black -\> white), while half were left unaltered (Fig. 4). This resulted in four treatments (cool-cool: CC; warm-warm: WW; cool-warm: CW; and warm-cool: WC) with a final sample size of 20 tiles per treatment (four per experimental block, five blocks). Some tiles were lost from this intended final number due to log damage and wave dislodgement. Final sample sizes are reported in the results section.

**Figure 4.** Stage 3 of the experimental design, when the decision was made to alter temperature for a subset of experimental tiles using heavy-duty tape. Pictured here: cool temperature tiles that were left unaltered between experiment years (CC treatment, left) and previously warm temperature tiles covered with heavy-duty white tape (WC treatment, right). Differences in barnacle cover after the first year are quite evident in this photograph.

<br/>

Temperature was monitored in each experimental temperature treatment using iButton temperature loggers (Maxim Integrated) embedded between the upper and lower units of tiles.

<br/>

#### Diversity surveys

Visual surveys were performed at monthly intervals during summer and every two months during winter from April 2019 (one month after experiment installation) to February 2021. During these, each species was identified and enumerated --- in the case of invertebrates --- or their percent cover measured --- in the case of algae. Organisms were identified down to species, or in cases where this was unclear (i.e. for amphipod and isopod crustaceans), coarser taxonomic measures were instead employed. Sessile species were only measured within the central 6 x 6 cm area with the aid of a small wire quadrat, while mobile species were enumerated on the entire upper face of the tile.

Infauna were sampled to record the diversity of meiofauna in September 2020 (after summer heat stress) and in February 2021 (to allow for winter recovery). Barnacles and associated fauna were scraped from experimental tile's settlement area and identified to species (where possible) and enumerated under a dissecting microscope.

<br/>

#### Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed in R version 4.1.1. Different response variables were analyzed using various modeling techniques, with a significance threshold of p = 0.05:

-   Maximum daily summertime low tide temperatures were analyzed with a Type II ANOVA through the *car* package, version 3.0.11. The model for temperature was built using the *glmmTMB* package, version 1.1.2.2, with random intercepts for both measurement date and the experiment block (for the final study design).

-   Community trajectory data, which essentially reflects the mean of the centroid for each treatment in nMDS plots at each timepoint, were plotted using the *ecotraj* package, version 0.0.1.

-   Infaunal community structure data, both from visual surveys and infaunal assemblage sampling, were analyzed using the *vegan* package, version 2.5.7. Algal cover and invertebrate abundance were each standardized to the maximum value for each species. In these cases, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plots were constructed with 999 permutations, and PERMANOVA and PERMDSIP analyses were run using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices with 9999 unrestricted permutations and a type III sum of squares. For these models, with fixed effects for the temperature treatment in year one, the temperature treatment in year two, and their interaction.

-   While not shown in the results, trends in Shannon diversity, richness, and evenness were explored using linear modeling and these models were tested using Type II ANOVA.

-   Barnacle abundance over time was analyzed using a generalized additive mixed effects model with a negative binomial error distribution through the *gamm4* package, version 0.2.6. Abundance for each species was also analyzed for the final timepoint alone using a generalized linear mixed effects model with a negative binomial error distribution through *glmmTMB*.

#### Temperature treatments

Temperature data generally indicate that the the passive temperature treatments functioned as intended (Fig. 5 & 6).

The greyed-out boxes indicate the winter period when low tides occur predominately at night, negating any effect of tile colour on degree of warming.

<br/>

When the maximum daily temperatures during summer low tides were averaged, we found that the warm temperature treatment (black tiles = 26.55 ± 0.51 ºC, mean ± SE) was hotter than both the rock temperature (24.47 ± 0.06 ºC) and the cool temperature treatment (white tiles = 24.64 ± 0.06 ºC). These differences drove a significant effect of treatment on maximum daily temperature (Type II ANOVA, *χ*^2^ = 1530, df = 2, p \< 0.001).

#### Community trajectories

In order to visualize how each treatment changed through time, we generated an ecological trajectory plot in nMDS space (Fig. 7). This plot clearly demonstrates that the treatment during the first year of study generated a dramatic effect, particularly as communities transitioned from summer to winter (indicated by the x symbol along the light blue and red lines in Fig. 7). Communities clustered more closely during the second summer of the study despite temperature differences, but small differences were still visually evident by the end of the summer of 2020 (\* symbol in Fig. 7), with the CC and WW being most different, and CW and WC intermediate between the two 'extremes' of community composition. Winter again drove divergence in treatments, with the CC, CW, and WC communities converging, and WW diverging substantially by the final time point in February 2021 (square symbols in Fig. 7.

**Figure 7.** nMDS plot of community trajectories found on experimental tiles over the course of the experiment (March 2019 - February 2021). Arrows indicate change from timepoint to timepoint for each treatment, and colour indicates treatment. C = cool, W = warm, and combinations thereof indicate the four sequential treatments generated by altering half of the temperature treatments for each original treatment group in June 2020. The relative proximity of points to each other indicates the similarity of communities in terms of both species present and their relative abundance/cover; close points indicate similarity, distant points indicate dissimilarity. x = October 2019, \* = September 2020, square = endpoint. Underlying species centroids are represented by open circles.

<br/>

#### Infaunal community structure

Community composition trends observed in the trajectory plot were explored by analyzing infaunal community structure in September 2020, when heat should have driven the greatest differences between treatments, and end of the experiment, February 2021, when any winter recovery should have been evident.

Surprisingly, according to nMDS plots, the opposite trend was found. In September 2020, communities were extremely similar in composition when all replicates were considered (Fig. 8), while in February 2021, some difference was still evident between the WW treatment and the rest (Fig. 9).

<br/>

These visual trends were followed up with PERMANOVA analyses to test if community composition did or did not differ between treatments. We found that there were no differences in the composition of invertebrate communities across treatments in September 2020, but that there were differences between treatments, driven by the WW treatment, after the winter had passed. Both the initial year's conditions (F.Model = 2.4061, df = 1, R^2^ = 0.05317, p = 0.0194), the second year's conditions( F.Model = 3.6313, df = 1, R^2^ = 0.08024, p = 0.0012), and their interaction (F.Model = 2.2178, df = 1, R^2^ = 0.04901, p = 0.0280) were statistically significant. There were no trends in dispersion --- that is, the beta diversity of communities, or degree variance in species composition between replicates, was not substantially different between treatments.

<br/>

#### Alpha diversity

The diversity of invertebrate communities on experimental tiles were explored from visual survey data. At the end of the summer in the second year of the experiment, a treatment effect was evident in determining Shannon diversity, with the consistently cool treatment having the greatest diversity of macrofauna, and all other treatments being similarly less diverse (Type II ANOVA, F = 3.5547, df = 3, p = 0.0180). A similar effect was seen with evenness, where consistently cool communities were more even (Type II ANOVA, F = 3.0963, df = 3, p = 0.0336). However, these effects disappeared after winter, when all treatments became homogeneous with respect to Shannon diversity and evenness. Species richness demonstrated no trends at either timepoint.

<br/>

#### Barnacle abundance & recruitment

From visual surveys, we noticed that in general, cool tiles had greater barnacle cover than warm tiles across years, and we decided to examine how abundances of the two species of acorn barnacle present, *B. glandula* and *C. dalli*, changed over time (Fig. 10).

**Figure 10.** Changes in the abundance of *B. glandula* (top)and *C. dalli* (bottom)on experimental tiles over time. The first year only includes two treatments, which form the basis of the four treatments generated in the second year of the experiment. Error bars represent standard error about the mean, and colour represents the temperature treatment applied (C = cool, W = warm).

Statistical models were used to examine these trends. From temporal patterns, it was evident that *B. glandula* at this site had a notable spike in recruitment in the spring of each year, resulting in a high abundance of very barnacles that declined over the summer and winter as barnacles died from the onset of summer temperatures or were crowded out by other individuals. There was significant pattern in recruitment over time during the first year, with recruitment peaking in the spring and declining thereafter (Type II ANOVA: *χ*^2^ = 1487, edf = 1.998, p \< 0.001). Higher temperatures in the first year resulted in fewer barnacles being present (Type II ANOVA: *χ*^2^ = 62.08, df = 1, p \< 0.001). Similar trends continued in the second year, with a significant non-linear temporal trend of barnacle abundance through time (Type II ANOVA: *χ*^2^ = 140.8, edf = 1.968, p \< 0.001). Tiles that experienced warm temperatures during the second year had lower barnacle abundance regardless of their temperature in the first year (Type II ANOVA, year 2 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 15.271, df = 1, p \< 0.001). The temperature experienced during the first year correlated with a lower abundance of barnacles in the second year of the study independent of the second year's temperature treatment, but this was not statistically significant (Type II ANOVA, year 1 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 3.480, df = 1, p = 0.0621). When the final timepoint was considered alone, both the first and second years of exposure to hot temperatures correlated with lower abundances of barnacles observed at the end of two years, though these p-values are proximate to the significance threshhold (Type II ANOVA, year 1 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 4.1315, df = 1, p = 0.0421; year 2 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 4.2056, df = 1, p = 0.0403).

*C. dalli* was not as abundant as *B. glandula* in general, particularly during the first year of the experiment, though it did become much more abundant in the second year. During the second year, we discerned a pattern of recruitment where *C. dalli* abundance peaked during summer, declining thereafter, which resulted in a significant smoothed function for time in our additive model (Type II ANOVA, *χ*^2^ = 282.4, edf = 1.977, p \< 0.001). The temperature treatment during the second year of the study, but not the first, had an effect on *C. dalli* abundance, with higher temperature correlating with fewer barnacles present (Type II ANOVA, year 2 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 6.313, df = 1, p = 0.0120). No differences in treatments were discernable at the final timepoint where tiles were surveyed.

We also examined barnacle recruitment patterns during the peak recruitment period for *B. glandula* in the second year of the experiment (Fig. 11). Tiles that experienced warm temperatures during either year of the study had a lesser recruitment of *B. glandula*, though the temperature experienced in the second year had a larger effect (Type II ANOVA, year 1 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 4.6101, df = 1, p = 0.0318; year 2 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 56.5136, df = 1, p \< 0.001). Only the temperature treatment of the second year affected recruit abundance of *C. dalli*, with warmer temperatures being correlated with fewer barnacles (Type II ANOVA, year 2 treatment: *χ*^2^ = 21.2629, df = 1, p \< 0.001).

**Figure 11**. Abundance of acorn barnacle recruits on experimental tiles following peak recruitment in the second year of the experiment (June 2020). Color represents temperature treatment applied to each tile (C = cool, W = warm).

## Preliminary conclusions

1.  Temperatures differed between experimental treatments, consistent with past experiments using this methodology.
2.  The first year of treatments drove substantial differences in community composition between treatments, particularly after winter. We suspect this may be because cool treatment tiles had greater barnacle cover, which created a greater diversity of microhabitats for invertebrates and algae to utilize during the less thermally stressful winter period when invertebrate abundance was generally observed to be greater.
3.  Infaunal community composiiton converged in the second summer, though differences became clear between the consistently warmed treatment and the rest of the treatments after the winter period had elapsed as in year one.
4.  While some short-term trends are evident in alpha diversity (Shannon diversity, evenness), these disappear after summer temperature stress ceases. Temperature-driven differences in beta diversity (variation in the identity of species within the community) seem to be the most substantial and long-lasting.
5.  *B. glandula* and *C. dalli*,the dominant acorn barnacles at this shore level, were less abundant when temperatures were hotter, which was driven by low recruitment. A lag effect of first-year temperature on the total abundance of *B. glandula* was near, but not beyond, the significance threshold, but recruitment of this species was affected by the temperature treatment of the previous year, probably because barnacle recruitment is gregarious and thus higher where adult barnacles are abundant (previously cool tiles). *C. dalli*, which is known to be more heat-tolerant, was only affected by the current summer's temperature when it arrive in the second year of the study.

These conclusions suggest that high intertidal barnacle bed communities may have some resilience to climate warming, but that this resilience is limited. Alpha diversity, which encompasses the number of species present and the homogeneity of their relative proportions in the community, experiences short-term declines from summer heat, though these impacts do not persist for long. Beta diversity appears to be affected by consecutive hot summers, suggesting that warm and cool-associated communities differed in the identity of their species, perhaps with heat-tolerant species occupying warm temperature treatments and heat-intolerant species occupying cool temperature treatments. Additionally, barnacle recruitment impacts may accrue over summers; barnacles, as gregarious settlers, preferentially occupy areas where adult barnacles are present. Thus, if hot summers are sequential, these communities may be altered in the future since localized barnacle recruitment success will be lower and infaunal communities will not have a chance to recover from persistent heat stress. We acknowledge, however, that our understanding of the potential impacts of heat waves in this region are only now coming into focus with the 2021 heat dome in the Pacific Northwest; challenges in the future may be greater than previously imagined.
