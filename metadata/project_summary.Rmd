## Questions

This experiment set out to test how temperature shapes the composition
of intertidal barnacle bed communities, asking the question: how do
single vs. successive hot summers affect this same community?

## Hypotheses

1.  Barnacle bed communities that are exposed to hotter temperatures
    during summer, even for a single year, will have lower diversity
    (species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, evenness, beta
    diversity) than those that are exposed to ambient/cooler conditions
    during the same period.

2.  Warming will exert a persistent effect through time (i.e., warming
    in year one will stil affect communities in year two) mediated by
    changes in the cover of biogenic habitat.

3.  Previously 'cool' communities, since they have more established,
    larger barnacle beds with a more diverse array of microhabitats and
    thermal refugia, will be less perturbed by warming than previously
    'warm' communities that have less structurally complex biogenic
    habitat. That is, the effect of warming in year two will be
    contigent upon warming in year one.

## Materials & Methods

#### Site description

This experiment was completed at Ruckle Provincial Park on the
southeast-facing, semi-exposed sandstone shore of Salt Spring Island,
located in British Columbia within the Salish Sea. Relative to the rest
of the southern Gulf Islands, this site receives more substantial wave
exposure and cooler, saltier water, being positioned more towards the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and away from the Fraser River plume. Thus, the
intertidal community at this site is substantially more diverse than
neighbouring islands. However, like the rest of the Gulf Islands, this
island's intertidal zone is a "hot spot" in the region due to its
mid-day summer low tides coupled with relatively clear, sunny weather
during the summer.

The upper intertidal zone at this site is dominated by acorn barnacles
(*Balanus glandula* and *Chthamalus dalli*), with sporadic beds of the
perennial brown alga *Fucus distichus* and patches of the crustose phase
of *Mastocarpus* sp.. Ephemeral algae can be found primarily in the
winter when temperatures less stressful, namely the green ephemeral
species *Ulothrix* sp. and *Ulva* sp., the red alga *Pyropia* sp., and
the brown alga *Petalonia fascia*. Herbivores are relatively plentiful
at this shore level, though some more thermally sensitive species
migrate down shore with the onset of summer temperatures (Hesketh,
personal observation). These include the littorine snails *Littorina
scutulata* and *L. sitkana* and the limpets *Lottia paradigitalis* and
congeners *L. digitalis*, *L. pelta*, and *L. scutum*.

<br/>

#### Experimental design

Measurements in this experiment were made at the level of individual
tiles deployed in the intertidal zone (Fig. 1). These tiles were
manufactured as in previous studies employing the same passive warming
method (@kordas2015). In short, tiles consisted of two units made from
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, a lower unit composed of
thicker white HDPE (9.5 mm) anchoring the tile to the underlying
bedrock, and an upper unit made of thinner HDPE (6.4 mm) that was either
white (cool temperature treatment) or black (warm temperature
treatment). A thin layer of Sea Goin' poxy putty (Permalite Plastics)
was spread in the central 6.9 x 6.9 cm area of the top unit to generate
a settlement surface. To enhance the fine-scale heterogeneity of the
surface, finely ground epsom salts were pressed into the putty as it
dried, and dissolved with water after drying to leave behind fine pock
marks. When tile colour was altered for a subset of tiles during the
second year of the study, this was accomplished using heavy-duty tape,
either white or black in colour (Gorilla Tape), with adhesion enhanced
by the application of super glue.

**Figure 1.** Experimental tiles deployed at Ruckle Provincial Park,
Salt Spring Island, pictured one year after their initial installation
on shore. Recruitment and growth of algae and barnacles is evident in
the central settlement area of each tile, while the outer black or white
area of each tile serves to passively generate the warm and cool
treatments used during this experiment, respectively.

<br/>

The experiment followed a stratified random design, which went through
several iterations as the original herbivore manipulation changed in
response to methodological complications, and then again after the final
question changed.

1.  **Original herbivory x warming design (March - June 2019):** In this
    design, we had five blocks of 20 tiles each, half of which were
    white and half of which were black. Copper fences were installed
    along the perimeter of each tile (0.511 mm thick, 3.8 cm high above
    the level of the tile). Each of these ten tiles had a different
    herbivore treatment applied: no herbivores, *L. paradigitalis*
    alone, *L. digitalis* alone, *L. scutulata* alone, *L. sitkana*
    alone, each two-way combination of herbivores, and all herbivores.
    Prior to treatments, we dissected a number of individuals of each
    species to determine the species-specific relationship between wet
    and dry tissue weight for each. Thus, when applying herbivores to
    the tiles, we attempted to standardize wet weight to \~120 mg of dry
    tissue weight per tile. Thus, there was one replicate of each
    treatment per tile, n=5 across all blocks.
2.  **Updated herbivory x warming design (June 2019 - August 2019):**
    For this design, tiles were moved to new locations to avoid log
    damage, log-damaged tiles were removed, and littorine snails were
    removed from the herbivore treatment pool since they were dislodged
    or appeared in treatments randomly due to wave action. This resulted
    in a new design of six experimental blocks with 16 tiles each, eight
    of which were black and eight of which were white. Only limpets were
    used in the herbivory treatments (Fig. 2), of which there were
    eight: no herbivores, *L. paradigitalis* alone, *L. digitalis*
    alone, *L. scutum* alone, each of the three two-species combinations
    of these, and all species. Thus, there was again a sample size of
    five per treatment, one replicate per block.

**Figure 2.** Stage 2 of experimental herbivore additions. Pictured
here: *L. digitalis* (large, ribbed limpet) and *L. paradigitalis*
(small limpets) added to a cool treatment tile in July 2019.

<br/>

3.  **Final design (August 2019-February 2021):** While the limpet
    manipulation worked reasonably well for *L. paradigitalis*, the
    other two limpet species more often than not died within two weeks
    of being added to tiles, presumably due to heat stress. What limpets
    of these species did survive were often found at the edges of the
    tile units, or wedged in the crack between the tile and copper
    fence, signaling that their grazing activity on the tile may be
    minimal. Thus, at this point the copper fences were removed from all
    tiles, and herbivores of all species were allowed to access and
    leave tiles freely. In April 2020, the colour of half of these tiles
    were changed (white -\> black or black -\> white), while half were
    left unaltered (Fig. 3). This resulted in four treatments
    (cool-cool: CC; warm-warm: WW; cool-warm: CW; and warm-cool: WC)
    with a final sample size of 20 tiles per treatment (four per
    experimental block, five blocks). Some tiles were lost from this
    intended final number due to log damage and wave dislodgement.

**Figure 3.** Stage 3 of the experimental design, when the decision was
made to alter temperature for a subset of experimental tiles using
heavy-duty tape. Pictured here: cool temperature tiles that were left
unaltered between experiment years (CC treatment, left) and previously
warm temperature tiles covered with heavy-duty white tape (WC treatment,
right). Differences in barnacle cover after the first year are quite
evident in this photograph.

Temperature was monitored in each experimental temperature treatment
using iButton temperature loggers (Maxim Integrated) embedded between
the upper and lower units of tiles.

#### Diversity surveys

Visual surveys were performed at monthly intervals during summer and
every two months during winter from April 2019 (one month after
experiment installation) to February 2021. During these, each species
was identified and enumerated --- in the case of invertebrates --- or
their percent cover measured --- in the case of algae. Organisms were
identified down to species, or in cases where this was unclear (i.e. for
amphipod and isopod crustaceans), coarser taxonomic measures were
instead employed. Sessile species were only measured within the central
6 x 6 cm area with the aid of a small wire quadrat, while mobile species
were enumerated on the entire upper face of the tile.

Tiles were destructively sampled to record the diversity of meiofauna in
September 2020 (after summer heat stress) and in February 2021 (to allow
for winter recovery). Barnacles and associated fauna were scraped from
experimental tile's settlement area and identified to species (where
possible) and counted under a dissecting microscope.
